# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a method to save important checkpoints. It is useful because we can reference or revert to these checkpoints if necessary.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a variation of the master. It is used when people are working on separate parts of the master code.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit saves a checkpoint. Ex: "Added Names and Ages"
* What is a merge conflict?
Merge conflict occurs when a pull request cannot be completed
